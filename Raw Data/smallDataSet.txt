They aim at making things more DRY and eliminating workarounds that used to be more clumsy. So while the Rails API may gain a few methods, it will actually make the programmer's experience using Rails more consistent and streamlined.\r\n\r\nThe beauty of a framework like rails is that you can use it without leveraging its full api - go ahead and write your stuff 'old skool' in 15 lines of code, and a few days later, you'll look over that code and you'll slash it down to a mere 3-4 lines using a rails method you've just discovered - it's a lot of fun.\r\n\r\nDHH said somewhere that Rails 1.0 should have been 2.0, because he doesn't see a lot of major additions any time soon. He's wisely pushed 'higher level' functionality (like login systems, etc.) into generators, plugins, engines, whatnot, to keep the framework uncluttered.
